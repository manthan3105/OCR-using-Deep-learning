# OCR-using-Deep-learning
This model was made to analyse PAN cards and AADHAR cards and save the inforation. So this model is trained on arial and calibri(languages that cards use) but additional languages can be trained upon by using their .ttf files.

This model can also be used for handwriting recognition if additional languages are used.
